# Implementation-of-Process-Scheduling-Algorithms-in-XINU
• Implemented two process scheduling algorithms, namely Lottery Scheduling (LS), and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) in
XINU and verified their correct operation with representative test cases.

• Carried out a fairness analysis for the Lottery Scheduling algorithm over a variety of runtimes for two user processes and
validated the expectations from the algorithm.
